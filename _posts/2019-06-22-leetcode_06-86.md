# Solved Problems

86. [Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)



## My Solution

```python
def partition(head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
    less = ListNode(0)
    great = ListNode(0)
    tmpLess = less
    tmpGreat = great
    while head != None:
        if head.val < x:
            tmpLess.next = ListNode(head.val)
            tmpLess = tmpLess.next
        else:
            tmpGreat.next = ListNode(head.val)
            tmpGreat = tmpGreat.next
        head = head.next
        
    tmpLess.next = great.next
    return less.next
```
